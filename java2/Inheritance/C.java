package Inheritance;
//A, B and C are classes. A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B. Create three methods in each class, 2 methods are specific to each class and third method (override method) should be in all three Classes A, B and C. Create a class with main method. Create an object for each class A, B and C in main method and call every method of each class using its own object/instance. Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C class’s objects. Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members/Instance variables, Repeat the above process only for data members
public class C extends B{
	int method1() {
		return 1;
	}
	String method2() {
		return "Jala";
	}
	double method() {
		return 10.00;
	}

}
